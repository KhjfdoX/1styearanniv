              A Love Letter i once wrote you.

              <p>
                i feel as though i am incapable of death as i sit beside you;
                your presence means an obligation to exist by your side,
                to declare you the most loved under the heavens and 
                to caress your tears away.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                This responsibility drives me to try, for you and our future that
                i dream of every night i cant sleep. You are the reason i can get out 
                of bed with gratitude and the reason i run with a smile after seeing you. 
                Lament your sorrows to me so i can wipe it clean off the earth, lead your 
                ideas to me so i can understand you.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                Love for me is finding a partner you can fight the inherent meaningless
                of life, rejecting and defying the cruel world, living separate from the suffering, 
                doubling the little joy we get from time to time, having at least one comfort in life.
              </p>
  
              <p>
                I have a feeling that if i were to spent the rest of my life
                with you i can live without regrets and if i were to regret
                ever it would be when i die leaving you alone. I love you.
